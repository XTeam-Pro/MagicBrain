# Commercial / Enterprise License (Dual Licensing) — MagicBrain

Author: Andrey Tikhonov

This Commercial / Enterprise License (“Commercial License”) governs paid commercial use of MagicBrain and related modules, when such use is not permitted under the applicable community/open-core license.

This document is intended to be used as a licensing agreement template and does not constitute legal advice.

## 1. Definitions

- “Licensor” means Andrey Tikhonov and/or the legal entity designated by him to grant commercial rights.
- “Licensee” means the individual or legal entity that purchases or otherwise receives a Commercial License from Licensor.
- “Software” means the source code, binaries, documentation, and related materials provided by Licensor under this Commercial License.
- “Open Core Components” means the parts of the Software that are distributed publicly under a community/open-core license intended for community value and non-commercial use.
- “Enterprise Components” means proprietary, paid modules, features, integrations, accelerations, agents, tools, or other deliverables that Licensor makes available only under this Commercial License (for example: reserved MagicBrain tooling).
- “Commercial Use” includes any use primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including SaaS/hosted offerings, internal business platforms, production deployments, and integration into commercial products or services.
- “Order” means the commercial document (invoice, order form, statement of work, or similar) that specifies fees, term, scope, support level, and any special terms for Licensee.

## 2. Dual-Licensing Overview

1. Open Core: Open Core Components are provided to the community for research, learning, personal projects, proofs-of-concept, and other non-commercial activities under the applicable community/open-core license.
2. Commercial / Enterprise: Any Commercial Use requires a valid Commercial License (this document + an Order). Without a Commercial License, Commercial Use is not authorized.
3. Module Matrix: Licensor may split deliverables into layers: (a) Open Core Components and (b) Enterprise Components available only under commercial subscription.

## 3. License Grant

Subject to continuous compliance with this Commercial License and payment of all applicable fees under the Order, Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (for breach), worldwide license during the Term to:

- use, reproduce, and modify the Software for Licensee’s internal business purposes and/or as expressly permitted in the Order;
- deploy the Software in production, including within commercial environments, and offer it as part of Licensee’s products or services as expressly permitted in the Order;
- access and use Enterprise Components provided to Licensee under the Order.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Licensor.

## 4. Term, Renewal, and Scope

- Term: The Commercial License is effective for the period stated in the Order (“Term”).
- Renewal: Renewal (if any) is as specified in the Order.
- Scope: Authorized usage limits (seats, nodes, environments, customers, revenue tiers, or other metrics) are defined in the Order. Use beyond the ordered scope requires an updated Order.

## 5. Restrictions

Unless expressly permitted by Licensor in writing (including via an Order), Licensee must not:

- resell, sublicense, or otherwise redistribute the Software or Enterprise Components on a standalone basis;
- provide the Enterprise Components (or access to them) to third parties except as embedded within Licensee’s permitted offering as specified in the Order;
- remove or alter proprietary notices, trademarks, or attributions included with the Software;
- use the Software in a manner that violates applicable law or third-party rights.

## 6. Support, Updates, and SLA

Commercial benefits may include one or more of the following, as specified in the Order:

- Support: response targets, channels, and scope.
- Updates: access to releases, security fixes, and patches during the Term.
- SLA: availability targets and service credits (if applicable).
- Consulting: architecture review, integrations, tuning, and other professional services.

If not specified in the Order, no SLA is provided, and support/updates are provided on a commercially reasonable efforts basis.

## 7. Closed Modules and Deliverables

Enterprise Components may be delivered as proprietary source code, binary artifacts, hosted features, configuration bundles, model/tuning assets, tooling, or other deliverables. Enterprise Components are licensed, not sold.

Licensee acknowledges that:

- Enterprise Components may not be publicly redistributed unless explicitly authorized;
- Licensor may offer different Enterprise Components to different customers based on subscription tier and module matrix.

## 8. Contributions and CLA

If Licensee or its personnel contribute code, documentation, or other materials to any publicly hosted repository within the MagicBrain ecosystem, such contributions may be subject to a Contributor License Agreement (“CLA”) required by Licensor. The CLA enables Licensor to manage dual licensing and future relicensing as needed.

## 9. Intellectual Property and Ownership

- Licensor retains all right, title, and interest in and to the Software, including Open Core Components and Enterprise Components, except for third-party components under their respective licenses.
- Licensee retains all rights to its own data, configurations, and content.
- Modifications: Unless otherwise agreed in the Order, Licensee owns its internal modifications, but grants Licensor a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and incorporate feedback and suggestions for improving the Software.

## 10. Fees and Taxes

Fees are as stated in the Order. Licensee is responsible for all applicable taxes, duties, and withholdings except taxes on Licensor’s net income.

## 11. Audit and Compliance

Upon reasonable notice and no more than once per 12-month period (unless a material breach is suspected), Licensor may request verification of compliance with scope limits in the Order. Licensee will provide reasonable information sufficient to confirm compliance. Any audit will be conducted in a manner that minimizes disruption and protects confidential information.

## 12. Confidentiality

Each party may receive non-public information from the other party that is marked or reasonably understood as confidential (“Confidential Information”). Each party will protect the other’s Confidential Information using reasonable safeguards and will not disclose it except to personnel/contractors who need to know and are bound by confidentiality obligations.

## 13. Warranty Disclaimer

Except as expressly set forth in the Order, the Software is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”, without warranties of any kind, whether express, implied, or statutory, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted.

## 14. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will Licensor be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, revenue, data, or goodwill, arising out of or related to this Commercial License, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, Licensor’s total aggregate liability arising out of or related to this Commercial License will not exceed the fees paid by Licensee to Licensor under the applicable Order in the 12 months preceding the event giving rise to liability.

## 15. Termination

- Termination for breach: Licensor may terminate this Commercial License immediately upon written notice if Licensee materially breaches and fails to cure within 30 days (or immediately for unauthorized redistribution or non-payment).
- Effect of termination: Upon termination or expiration, Licensee must cease using the Enterprise Components and any rights granted under this Commercial License, except those that expressly survive.
- Survival: Sections relating to ownership, restrictions, confidentiality, disclaimers, limitation of liability, and any payment obligations survive termination.

## 16. Governing Law and Disputes

Governing law, venue, and dispute resolution mechanism (court/arbitration) are as specified in the Order. If not specified, the parties will agree in good faith before initiating formal proceedings.

## 17. Entire Agreement and Order of Precedence

This Commercial License plus the applicable Order constitutes the entire agreement regarding Commercial Use of the Software and supersedes prior discussions. In case of conflict, the Order controls for commercial terms (scope, fees, SLA), and this Commercial License controls for licensing and legal terms unless the Order explicitly overrides a section.

## 18. How to Obtain a Commercial License

To use the Software commercially (SaaS, internal platforms, integrations in a product, or other Commercial Use), Licensee must obtain a paid Commercial License from Licensor and receive an Order confirming the scope and benefits (support, updates, SLA, consulting, and access to Enterprise Components).
